# BusyBox

BusyBox is a software suite that provides several stripped-down Unix tools and utilities in a single executable file. It is commonly used in embedded Linux systems due to its small size and efficient use of system resources. 
## Steps

### Download
 -  To download go to https://busybox.net/ 
   
### Extract 
 -  After tar the file ``` cd busybox-1.35.1 ``` to extract the file
   
### Writing Compiler PATH
 -  CROSS_COMPILE= <PATH> to choose your cross compile path
   
### Configration Edit
 - To make default conifigrations ```  make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=../arm-gnu-toolchain/bin/arm-none-linux-gnueabihf- defconfig ``` 
 - Go to menuconfig to change and add you feature selection for ur busybox ``` make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=../arm-gnu-toolchain/bin/arm-none-linux-gnueabihf- -menuconfig ```

### Make compile
 -  ``` make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=../arm-gnu-toolchain/bin/arm-none-linux-gnueabihf- -j12 ```  The -j option in the make command specifies the number of jobs (parallel processes) that make is allowed to run simultaneously. In your example, -j12 indicates that make should run up to 12 jobs simultaneously, which can speed up the build process by utilizing multiple CPU cores.

Choosing the number 12 may depend on factors such as the number of CPU cores available on your system and the amount of available memory. In general, setting the number of jobs (-j) to a value close to the number of CPU cores can help maximize the utilization of system resources without overwhelming the system with too many parallel processes.

However, the optimal value for -j may vary depending on the specific hardware configuration and the complexity of the build process. It's often recommended to experiment with different values to find the best balance between build speed and system stability.

 - ``` make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=../arm-gnu-toolchain/bin/arm-none-linux-gnueabihf- -j12 install ```
   he install target in the make command typically copies built files from the build directory to their destination directories, making them accessible for system-wide use.
